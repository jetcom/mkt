mkt is a program design to read test questions from 1 or more files and
generate written exams.  The config files can specify the maximum number of
points for a group of questions, or the maximum number of questions to pick
from a set.  This makes it possible to have n different ways to ask a
questions, and leaving it up to mkt to pick one at random.  

mkt outputs files in LaTeX format and will optionally generate
pdf files from the tex file.  

By default, a corresponding answer key is generated for the supplied test.


mkt supports the following types of questions:
   * long answer - at least one sentance for the answer
   * short answer - typically one word answers
   * multiple choice 

The example folder provides samples of how mkt can be used. To run mkt with
these samples, run:
   ./mkt examples/sample.ini outdir/exam.tex 

Optional arguments include:
   -v <#> - generate multiple copies of the same exam with where only the 
            order of the questions and the multiple choice answers differs
   -p     - generate pdfs.  If you chose this option, it is highly recommended
            you output your files into a separate directory
   -f     - overwrite existing files
   -n     - do NOT generate and answer key
   -t     - test mode. Ignore all restrictions on maximum number of questions
            or maximum number of points
   -u <ID>- Used as the random seed for tests. Using the same question set and
            UUID as a previous test will generate identical tests
