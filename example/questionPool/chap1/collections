If you had to maintain an unsorted collection of data, and you had to insert
and remove elements from the middle of the collection, what container would
you chose, and why?
'''
solution='''
A list would be the container of choice because it efficiently adds elements
to the middle of the list. This works because a list actually implements a
doubly linked list and no data has to be shifted in order to add elements to
the middle
